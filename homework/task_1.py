# Task: Explore the basic concepts of linear algebra using Python.

# 1. Import the numpy library which will be used for matrix and vector operations.



# 2. Use the numpy library to create a vector v = [1, 2, 3] and a matrix A as:
# | 1 2 3 |
# | 4 5 6 |
# | 7 8 9 |



# 3. Print the text: Vector v: ? where ? is replaced with the vector v.



# 4. Print the text: Matrix A: ? where ? is replaced with the matrix A.



# 5. Initialize the vector v_add to be the sum of v and itself.



# 6. Print the text: Vector addition (v + v): ? where ? is replaced with the vector v_add.



# 7. Initialize the vector v_scalar_mult to be the product of the scalar 2 and the vector v.



# 8. Print the text: Scalar Multiplication (2 * v): ? where ? is replaced with the vector v_scalar_mult.



# 9. Initialize the matrix A_add to be the sum of A and itself.



# 10. Print the text: Matrix addition (A + A): ? where ? is replaced with the matrix A_add.



# 11. Initialize the vector Av_mult to be the product of the matrix A and the vector v.



# 12. Print the text: Matrix-vector multiplication (A * v): ? where ? is replaced with the vector Av_mult.



# 13. Initialize the matrix I to be the 3x3 identity matrix.



# 14. Initialize the matrix A_mult to be the product of the matrix A and the matrix I.



# 15. Print the text: Matrix-matrix multiplication (A * I): ? where ? is replaced with the matrix A_mult.



# 16. Initialize the matrix A_transpose to be the transpose of the matrix A.



# 17. Print the text: Transpose of matrix A: ? where ? is replaced with the matrix A_transpose.



# 18. Initialize the value v_norm to be the Euclidean norm of the vector v.



# 19. Print the text: Euclidean norm of vector v: ? where ? is replaced with the value v_norm.
